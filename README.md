My name is **Oleksiy** and I am **trying to make this world slightly better, using my data science toolkit**

* I am a student at the **University of Chicago**. My full professional profile is available on [**LinkedIn**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/oanokhin/)

* Before joining UChicago, I worked at the **World Bank Group** in Washington, DC

* I study various aspects of **machine learning** every day. These days I am all about **deep learning**, resolving **healthcare problems, using image recognition and natural language processing**

* My **growing skill set** includes/will include:

  + **Programming Languages:** **Python** (NumPy, pandas, Matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, PyCaret), **R** (tidyverse, tidymodels, leaflet, shiny, RMarkdown), **SQL**

  + **Modeling techniques:** **Supervised Learning** (DT, RF, SVM, XGBoost, etc), **Unsupervised Learning** (Hierarchical Clustering, k-means, DBSCAN), **Dimensionality Reduction** (PCA, t-SNE, SVD), **Time Series Analysis** (ARIMA, SARIMA, ARCH, GARCH), **Deep Learning** (ANN, RNN, CNN, Encoders)

  + **Big Data Platforms:** Hadoop, Hive, PySpark, Spark ML, GCP, AWS

  + **Deep Learning Libraries:** TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch

  + **Other:** Docker, Kubernetes, Neo4J, MongoDB, Tableau, GitHub, Git

* In my spare time I am passionate about **solving global problems (climate change, health issues, poverty, crime etc)** with data science solutions and ocasionally write articles about such topics and data ([example 1](https://voxukraine.org/en/where-are-ukrainian-brains-drained-to-and-how/) and [example 2](https://voxukraine.org/en/traffic-accidents-routes-fines-big-data-in-the-transport-section/))

* Fun fact: My first degree was ... **Law** :)
